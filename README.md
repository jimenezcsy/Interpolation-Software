# Interpolation-Software
1) A software system for numerical integration shall be designed
  
2) The system shall utilize the following methods:
a) Lagrange interpolation for finding missing values of a function
b) A function implementing multiple application of the trapezoidal rule
c) A function implementing the composite Simpsons rule

3) The user shall be able to
a) Enter the known values of a function to be integrated or load them from a text file
b) Enter a value of the parameter h and n (the number of intervals)
c) Choose a method to be used

4) The following output should be created: a value of the integral found
